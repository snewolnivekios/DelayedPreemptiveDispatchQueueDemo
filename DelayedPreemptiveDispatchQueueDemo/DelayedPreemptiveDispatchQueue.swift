/// With a delayed preemptive dispatch queue, you can delay execution of some task for a period of time, then later extend that time or preempt execution of the task, either by replacing it with some other task or by canceling it altogether.
///
/// The task may be provided via `init(label:task:)`, `delay(_:task:)`, or a combination of both. Neither the delay times nor tasks need be the same with each call. Only the last task submitted will be called once _all_ concurrent delay timers have expired. While you cannot cancel the timers, you can cancel execution of the associated task via `cancel()`. Once all timers have expired, you can reuse the `DelayedPreemptiveDispatchQueue` with or without specifying a new task.
///
/// While this class makes use of the `DispatchGroup` to manage a group of timers, this same functionality is not inherent to it. For example, you cannot provide a task closure to a `DispatchGroup` at initilization, but only via its instance `notify()` method. Also, all closures submitted to a dispatch group execute; there is no "preemption".

  ///
  /// - parameter seconds: The number of seconds before this or the initializer-givn task may be executed. The delay will be longer if there is a pending delay that expires after this period.
  /// - parameter task: The closure to run after _all_ pending delays have expired. If `nil` (the default), the task to be run is that given at initialization. If no task was given during initialization or at any call to this method, it takes no action.
